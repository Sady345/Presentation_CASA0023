## Problem

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4nw2r72l5ro

## Improvements since ULEZ

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/07/london-air-pollution-down-since-ulez-expansion-study

https://www.thetimes.com/uk/environment/article/expanded-ulez-cuts-emissions-nitrogen-dioxide-d5tz22fdr

Are these enough?  Percentage decrease mentioned but not actual levels. What are the actual levels? Are they still at harmful level?

# Policy

## Sustainable Development Goals:

- *SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities*
 - Target 11.6: By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management.
 - Indicator 11.6.2: Annual mean levels of fine particulate matter (e.g., PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀) in cities (population-weighted).
 
- *SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being*
 - Target 3.9: By 2030, substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water, and soil pollution and contamination.
 - Indicator 3.9.1: Mortality rate attributed to household and ambient air pollution.

# Policy

## London Plan 2021

- *GG3: Creating a healthy city*
 - GG3F: seek to improve London’s air quality, reduce public exposure to poor air quality and minimise inequalities in levels of exposure to air pollution
- *SI1: Improving Air Quality*
 - Identify and deliver further improvements to air quality and should not reduce air quality benefits that result from the Mayor’s or boroughs’ activities to improve air quality.
 - Tackle poor air quality and protect health.
 - Development should not: 
  - lead to further deterioration of existing poor air quality
  - create any new areas that exceed air quality limits, or delay compliance
  - create unacceptable risk of exposure to poor air quality

# Embedding within BAU

# Limitations


---

# Project Planning - Timelines

- Gant Chart
- Possibly split into work packages

---

# Project Planning - Work Packages

- Details of each work package
- Possibly overlaps the Process slide so need to see how this works in practice
